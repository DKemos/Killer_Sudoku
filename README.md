# Killer Suduku

![alt text](https://ibb.co/g5iYeo)
The Killer Sudokus are like ordinary Sudoku problems in that each row, column and block (3x2 region marked by bold lines above) 
must contain the numbers 1 to 6 and each number can only occur once in each row, column, and block. In addition, 
for Killer Sudoku problems, there are additional regions known as cages marked by dashed lines. Each cage has a 
value associated with it and the value of the cells in each cage must add up to the given total. For example, 
in the top row, the first two cells should add up to 7.
